# microservices-tutorial

This project is based on the Microservices in Spring Boot and Spring Cloud tutorial on udemy by in28Minutes. 

Through this project one learns to implement different components/concepts in microservices like 
        api-gateway using spring cloud dependency,
        distributed tracing using zipkin,
        centralized configuration using git repo,
        naming-server using netflix-eureka-client,
        communication between microservices using feign client etc.

One also learns to build docker images of the microservices and run all of them simultaneously using docker-compose.yaml file.
